  #+CINDEX:course description
  React makes it intuitive to build real-world web application. But in
  reality, you need to use a host of other services to get the app in
  front of real users.  This course walks you through setup and
  implementation to get your cloud-based application up and running.
  You’ll learn to set up:

  - a new project in AWS Amplify configured to your React app
  - user authentication with Amazon Cognito
  - managed GraphQL with AWS AppSync
  - image storage and retrieval with Amazon S3
  - text translation via Lambda functions
  - and finally, deployment of your application on AWS using Amazon S3


  You’ll finish the course ready to quickly and easily deploy your
  serverless React application, so users can start using and enjoying
  it right away.
